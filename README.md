## Description

Mankind has been plagued by COVID-19 with no end in sight.  We created an app that will help track COVID-19 statistics worldwide.  The user will be presented with global statistics in an interactive dashboard, tracking the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.  The information is organized by country and based on the open COVID-19 dataset provide by multiple sources such as Johns Hopkins University.  A quick access button is used to quickly see the Top 10 Countries Effected or the user can chose from an array of countries to see the specified data.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
